= loom-http

This exercise uses my Project Loom fork to implement an HTTP server.

You can find my Project Loom fork here: https://github.com/pedrolamarao/jdk-loom

It uses Project Loom's virtual thread for the basic concurrency architecture.

It uses my implementation of continuation-based generators for the HTTP request parser.

You *must* use a build from my Project Loom fork!
I do not provide pre-compiled binaries at this time.
Sorry.

To build: `./gradlew shadowJar`

To run: `java --enable-preview -jar .\build\libs\loom-http-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar --address http://localhost:12345`
