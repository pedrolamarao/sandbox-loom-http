= loom-http

This is an exercise for Java's Project Loom.

In this exercise we use Jetty's `HttpParser` to build a dummy HTTP server with Loom's virtual threads. The server should consume any request and always respond with the smalled 404 possible.

You *must* use a Project Loom early access build!
Look for them here: http://jdk.java.net/loom/

To build: `./gradlew shadowJar`

To run: `java --enable-preview -jar .\build\libs\loom-http-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar --address http://localhost:12345`
